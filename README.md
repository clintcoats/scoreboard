# scoreboard
!!FIRST PROJECT!! Scoreboards for my game room.  I am looking to create a scoreboard page/app to keep score of all the games in my game room.  Ping pong, darts, pool, air hockey.

Again this is my first project.  I am coming from the PLC logic programming world.  However I see many opportunities to make use of and expanded programming knowledge in my day to day.  What a better way to learn other languages than to create a page/app to keep tally on the but whoopin' happening in the game room!!! lol My 2 cents anyhow.

Please keep in mind that I am a total newb when it comes to writing code in this environment.  Any and all help/suggestions are greatly appreciated and welcomed.
